# Operator Penugasan
* ``` a = a + 10 ``` -> ``` a += 10 ```
* ``` a = a - 10 ``` -> ``` a -= 10 ```
* ``` a = a * 10 ``` -> ``` a *= 10 ```
* ``` a = a / 10 ``` -> ``` a /= 10 ```
* ``` a = a ~/ 10 ``` -> ``` a ~/= 10 ```
* ``` a = a % 10 ``` -> ``` a %= 10 ```

# Increment dan Decrement
* ``` ++var ``` -> ``` var = var + 1 ``` (expression is var + 1)
* ``` var++ ``` -> ``` var = var + 1 ``` (expression is var)
* ``` --var ``` -> ``` var = var - 1 ``` (expression is var -1)
* ``` var-- ``` -> ``` var = var - 1 ``` (expression is var)
